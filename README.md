## Cimple_ui

Cimple_ui is a lightweight and easy-to-use GUI library for C.

Combining my strings, and arena memory libraries, Cimple_ui provides a simple way to create graphical user interfaces in C.

### Development
Still in development, and improving the implementation of the existing libs and how they interact with each other.

Stay locked in for more :)
